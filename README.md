This repository holds all of the scripts from Kobie Kirven's rotation project 
in the Davenport lab at Penn State University. The goal of the project was to 
find a way to determine host sex using shotgun metagenomic data. 

The main directory is broken up into several sub-directories:
- bin/ - Holds all of the scripts for data gathering and manipulation
- results/ - Lab notebook as well as well as all figures generated from bin/
- data/ - Directories to hold downloaded data as well as intermediate files
